## JWT

Zero-dependencies, minimal JWT validation/verification support.

It only requires wiring a JSON parser (through a simple interface) such as [Gson](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson) but you can also use Jackson, or your own parser if you wish.

JWT feature support is incomplete, but the code is simple and straightforward.

PR contributions are welcome and encouraged.
